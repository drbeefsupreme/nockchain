/// The Persistent Memory Arena
///
/// A bump-allocated memory region for storing nouns in offset form.
/// The PMA is backed by a file (in future milestones) and persists across
/// program restarts.
///
/// "Bump-allocated" means allocation simply increments the `alloc_offset`
/// pointer by the requested size—there is no free list, no compaction, and
/// no mechanism to reclaim memory once allocated. This makes allocation
/// extremely fast (just a pointer bump) but means the PMA grows monotonically
/// until explicitly reset.
///
/// When a Noun that lives in the PMA needs to be modified, the workflow is:
/// 1. The Noun is read from the PMA (already in offset form)
/// 2. Modifications happen in the NockStack (ephemeral working memory)
/// 3. The modified Noun is copied back to the PMA via `copy_to_pma()`
///
/// Step 3 only allocates space for the Allocated subtrees that changed. For
/// example, if `[2 3]` becomes `[4 3]`:
/// - The Cell is Allocated, so a NEW cell is allocated in the PMA with head=4,
///   tail=3 with new DirectAtoms for the 4 and 3 since they are not Allocated.
/// - The old `[2 3]` cell remains in the PMA, untouched but now unreachable
///
/// For Allocated structures, unchanged subtrees that are already in PMA (offset
/// form) are reused without copying. If `[[1 2] 3]` becomes `[[1 2] 4]`:
/// - A NEW outer cell is allocated with tail=4
/// - The head still points to the existing `[1 2]` in PMA (no copy needed)
/// - Only the old outer cell becomes garbage; `[1 2]` is shared
///
/// This copy allocates fresh space in the PMA for the new version—the old
/// version is not overwritten or freed, it simply becomes unreachable garbage.
/// Garbage collection (Milestone 4) will eventually reclaim this dead space.
///
/// Currently Pma is only suitable for a single reader/writer. In the future,
/// `alloc_offset` will be changed to `AtomicUsize` to allow multiple readers.
